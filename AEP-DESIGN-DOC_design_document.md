## Detailed Design

### System Architecture
The system will employ a microservices architecture hosted on Kubernetes clusters within a cloud provider environment (AWS/Azure/GCP). The architecture will consist of distinct functional domains organized around business capabilities, with each microservice responsible for a specific bounded context. API Gateway pattern will be implemented to manage north-south traffic, while service mesh technology (Istio/Linkerd) will handle east-west communication and provide observability features.

The infrastructure will utilize infrastructure-as-code principles with Terraform for provisioning and Kubernetes manifests for application deployment. Continuous deployment pipelines will automate testing and promotion through development, staging, and production environments. Monitoring will be implemented through Prometheus for metrics collection, Grafana for visualization, and ELK stack for log aggregation and analysis.

Data persistence will utilize both relational (PostgreSQL) and non-relational (Redis, MongoDB) databases based on specific use cases, with appropriate replication and backup strategies. Object storage will be employed for large binary assets and documents. Caching layers will be implemented at multiple levels including CDN, application caching, and database query caching.

### Components
**API Gateway Service**: Responsible for request routing, authentication, rate limiting, and request/response transformation. Will implement OAuth 2.0 and JWT validation for securing endpoints.

**Core Business Logic Services**: Multiple microservices handling specific business domains:
- User Management Service: Handles user registration, authentication, profile management, and access control
- Data Processing Service: Manages core business transactions and data validation
- Reporting Service: Generates analytical reports and business intelligence data
- Notification Service: Handles email, SMS, and push notification delivery

**Data Storage Layer**: 
- Primary Database: PostgreSQL with read replicas for scaling read operations
- Cache: Redis cluster for session storage and frequently accessed data
- Document Store: MongoDB for unstructured data and document storage
- Object Storage: S3-compatible storage for large files and media assets

**Integration Layer**: Dedicated services for communicating with external systems including:
- CRM Integration Service: Bi-directional synchronization with customer data
- Payment Gateway Service: Secure payment processing integration
- Legacy System Adapter: Protocol translation for older systems

**Monitoring and Observability Stack**: 
- Metrics Collector: Prometheus with custom exporters
- Log Aggregator: Fluentd -> Elasticsearch pipeline
- Distributed Tracing: Jaeger implementation for request correlation
- Alert Manager: Configurable alerting rules and notification channels

### Data Models / Schemas
The core data model will revolve around several key entities:

**User Entity**: 
- userId (UUID, primary key)
- username (string, unique)
- email (string, indexed)
- passwordHash (binary)
- roles (array of enum)
- metadata (JSONB)
- timestamps (createdAt, updatedAt)

**Business Transaction Entity**:
- transactionId (UUID)
- userId (foreign key)
- type (enum)
- status (enum)
- amount (decimal)
- currency (string)
- relatedEntities (array of references)
- auditTrail (JSONB for change history)

**Document Entity**:
- documentId (UUID)
- ownerId (foreign key)
- storagePath (string)
- mimeType (string)
- size (integer)
- accessControlList (JSONB)
- versionInfo (object)

Database schemas will implement appropriate normalization levels with carefully considered denormalization for performance-critical queries. Indexing strategies will include composite indexes for common query patterns and partial indexes for frequently filtered columns. Migration scripts will be version-controlled and applied through automated deployment pipelines.

### APIs / Interfaces
The system will expose RESTful APIs following OpenAPI 3.0 specification with comprehensive documentation. All APIs will require authentication via Bearer tokens obtained through OAuth 2.0 flows.

**Core Endpoints**:
- `POST /api/v1/auth/login` - User authentication
- `GET /api/v1/users/{id}` - Retrieve user profile
- `POST /api/v1/transactions` - Create new transaction
- `GET /api/v1/reports/{type}` - Generate business reports
- `WS /api/v1/notifications` - WebSocket for real-time notifications

Request/response formats will follow JSON API standards with consistent error handling using HTTP status codes and detailed error messages. Rate limiting will be implemented using token bucket algorithm with configurable limits per API endpoint. Versioning will be managed through URL path versioning with backward compatibility maintained for at least two previous versions.

External integrations will utilize both synchronous REST APIs and asynchronous messaging patterns depending on latency and reliability requirements. Message queues (RabbitMQ/Kafka) will be employed for guaranteed delivery of integration messages with dead-letter queue handling for failed processing.

### User Interface
The web interface will be built using React with TypeScript, employing a component-based architecture with reusable UI components. The design system will follow WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility standards with keyboard navigation, screen reader support, and color contrast compliance.

**Key User Flows**:
- Registration and onboarding process with progressive profiling
- Dashboard with personalized widgets and key metrics
- Data entry forms with real-time validation and helpful error messages
- Administrative interface for user management and system configuration
- Reporting interface with filtering, sorting, and export capabilities

The UI will implement responsive design principles supporting desktop, tablet, and mobile form factors. Performance optimizations will include code splitting, lazy loading, and efficient state management. Internationalization support will be built-in with locale-specific formatting and translation infrastructure.

## Risks and Mitigations

**Technical Risks**:
- *Risk:* Microservices complexity leading to operational overhead

- *Risk:* Performance degradation under load
  *Mitigation:* Conduct thorough load testing, implement caching strategies, and establish auto-scaling policies with proper monitoring

**Operational Risks**:
- *Risk:* Insufficient operational readiness for production support
  *Mitigation:* Develop comprehensive runbooks, establish monitoring and alerting thresholds, and conduct knowledge transfer sessions with operations team

- *Risk:* Security vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies

  *Mitigation:* Establish change control process, maintain frequent stakeholder communication, and employ agile methodology with iterative delivery

- *Risk:* User adoption challenges
  *Mitigation:* Conduct user testing throughout development, provide comprehensive training materials, and establish feedback mechanisms for continuous improvement

## Testing Strategy

The testing approach will employ a multi-layered strategy ensuring quality throughout the development lifecycle:

**Unit Testing**: Comprehensive test coverage (>90%) for all business logic using Jest (frontend) and JUnit/Mockito (backend). Test-driven development practices will be encouraged for critical components.

**Integration Testing**: Service-to-service testing using contract testing with Pact for API compatibility verification. Database integration tests will validate persistence layer behavior.

**End-to-End Testing**: Cypress tests for critical user journeys covering happy paths and error scenarios. Tests will run against production-like environments with mocked external dependencies.

**Performance Testing**: Gatling tests simulating realistic user loads to identify bottlenecks and validate scalability assumptions. Tests will include ramp-up, steady-state, and stress testing scenarios.

**Security Testing**: Automated SAST and DAST scanning integrated into CI/CD pipeline. Regular penetration testing by third-party security experts before major releases.

**User Acceptance Testing**: Structured UAT process with clearly defined test scenarios and success criteria. Pilot program with selected users before general availability release.

**Accessibility Testing**: Automated accessibility testing with axe-core complemented by manual testing with screen readers and keyboard navigation verification.
