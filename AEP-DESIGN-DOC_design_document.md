# Project Title: Enterprise Data Analytics Platform  
## Authors  
- [Alex Johnson](mailto:alex.johnson@example.com)  

## Overview  
The Enterprise Data Analytics Platform (EDAP) is a scalable, cloud-native solution designed to unify data ingestion, processing, and visualization across the organization. It empowers business units with self-service analytics, real-time dashboards, and AI-driven insights while ensuring data governance and compliance.  

## Background and Motivation  
Legacy systems suffer from siloed data, slow batch processing, and limited scalability, leading to delayed decision-making. EDAP addresses these pain points by:  
- Consolidating disparate data sources into a single platform.  
- Reducing ETL latency from hours to near-real-time.  
- Enabling advanced analytics (ML, predictive modeling) with minimal technical overhead.  
Business drivers include regulatory reporting requirements, competitive pressure for data-driven strategies, and a 40% YoY growth in data volume.  

## Goals and Non-Goals  

### Goals  
1. **Unified Data Lake**: Centralize structured/unstructured data with schema-on-read support.  
2. **Real-Time Processing**: Achieve <5s latency for streaming data pipelines (Kafka, Flink).  
3. **Self-Service Tools**: Low-code UI for ad-hoc queries and dashboard creation (Tableau/Power BI integration).  
4. **Governance**: Role-based access control (RBAC), data lineage tracking, and GDPR compliance.  
5. **Scalability**: Support 10TB/day ingestion and 1,000+ concurrent users.  

### Non-Goals  
- Replacing existing transactional databases (OLTP systems remain unchanged).  
- Custom ML model development (leverages existing Azure ML/PyTorch integrations).  
- On-premises deployment (cloud-only in Phase 1).  

## Detailed Design  

### System Architecture  
![EDAP Architecture Diagram](diagrams/edap_architecture.png) *[Hypothetical: Shows ingestion layer (Kafka), processing (Spark/Flink), storage (Delta Lake), serving (API/BI)]*  

- **Ingestion Layer**: Kafka for event streaming, Airflow for batch ETL.  
- **Processing Layer**: Spark for batch, Flink for streaming, Databricks for orchestration.  
- **Storage**: Delta Lake (Parquet format) with metadata catalog (AWS Glue).  
- **Serving Layer**: REST APIs (FastAPI), pre-aggregated datasets (Materialized Views), and BI connectors.  

### Components  
1. **Data Ingestion Service**  
   - Responsibilities: Validate, deduplicate, and route data to raw/curated zones.  
   - Dependencies: Kafka topics, schema registry (Avro), and IAM policies for source systems.  

2. **Stream Processing Engine**  
   - Flink jobs for windowed aggregations, anomaly detection (3σ thresholds).  
   - Stateful checkpoints to S3 for fault tolerance.  

3. **Governance Module**  
   - Data lineage via OpenLineage, column-level encryption (AWS KMS).  
   - Audit logs (Elasticsearch) for all access events.  

### Data Models  
| Table          | Fields                          | Partition Key       |  
|----------------|---------------------------------|---------------------|  
| `user_events`  | `event_id, user_id, timestamp`  | `date(timestamp)`   |  
| `sales_fact`   | `product_id, region, revenue`   | `quarter`           |  

*Schema Versioning*: Delta Lake’s time travel for rollbacks.  

### APIs / Interfaces  
- **Public API**:  
  - `POST /api/v1/ingest` (Auth: OAuth2.0, Payload: Avro-serialized events).  
  - `GET /api/v1/datasets/{id}` (Cache-Control: max-age=300).  
- **Internal**: gRPC for inter-service communication (protobuf contracts).  

### User Interface  
- **Analytics Portal**: React-based, with drag-and-drop query builder (SQL/Python kernels).  
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliant, screen reader support.  

## Risks and Mitigations  
| Risk                          | Mitigation                                  |  
|-------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|  
| Data quality issues in source systems | Implement data contracts + quarantine zone for invalid records. |  
| Vendor lock-in (Delta Lake)   | Abstract storage layer with Iceberg adapter. |  
| Cost overruns (cloud spend)   | Auto-scaling policies + budget alerts.      |  

## Testing Strategy  
- **Unit Tests**: 90% coverage (PyTest for Python modules, JUnit for Java).  
- **Integration**: Testcontainers for local Kafka/PostgreSQL dependencies.  
- **Performance**: Locust for API load testing (10K RPS target).  
- **UAT**: Pilot with Finance team (validate report accuracy).  

## Dependencies  
- **Technical**: Apache Spark 3.3, Delta Lake 2.0, AWS EMR.  
- **Organizational**: Data Governance Team (for policy definitions).  
- **Timing**: Must align with Q4 fiscal year reporting deadlines.  

## Conclusion  
EDAP transforms raw data into actionable insights with enterprise-grade reliability. Phase 1 delivers core ingestion and governance, laying the foundation for AI/ML workloads in Phase 2. Next steps include finalizing vendor contracts and onboarding pilot teams.
