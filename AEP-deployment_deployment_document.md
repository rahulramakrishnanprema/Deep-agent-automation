## REQUIREMENTS SPECIFICATION

```
Based on the comprehensive analysis of the AEP project issues, the following deployment requirements specification has been developed:

### INFRASTRUCTURE REQUIREMENTS

The AEP project requires a multi-tier infrastructure architecture supporting development, staging, and production environments. The infrastructure must support a Node.js/Express backend API, React frontend application, and PostgreSQL database system.

**Server Specifications:**
- Development Environment: 2 vCPUs, 4GB RAM, 20GB storage per instance
- Staging Environment: 4 vCPUs, 8GB RAM, 50GB storage per instance  
- Production Environment: 8 vCPUs, 16GB RAM, 100GB storage per instance (scalable)
- All environments require Ubuntu 20.04 LTS or equivalent Linux distribution

**Cloud Resources:**
- Cloud provider (AWS/Azure/GCP) with VPC networking capabilities
- Database-as-a-Service (PostgreSQL) for staging and production
- Container registry for Docker image storage
- CDN for frontend asset delivery
- Load balancers for production traffic distribution
- SSL/TLS certificate management service

**Networking Needs:**
- VPC with public and private subnets
- Security groups restricting traffic to necessary ports only
- VPN/SSH access for development team to staging environment
- Domain name registration and DNS management
- API gateway for request routing and management

### DEPLOYMENT REQUIREMENTS

**Deployment Strategies:**
- Blue-green deployment for zero-downtime releases
- Canary releases for high-risk feature deployments
- Automated rollback capabilities for failed deployments
- Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) using Terraform or CloudFormation

**Environment Configurations:**
- Development: Local development with Docker Compose, hot-reload enabled
- Staging: Mirrors production with test data, automated testing integration
- Production: Optimized for performance, security, and reliability

**Scaling Needs:**
- Horizontal scaling for API servers based on CPU/memory utilization
- Database read replicas for high read throughput
- Frontend caching strategies for static assets
- Auto-scaling groups with minimum 2 instances in production

### SECURITY REQUIREMENTS

**Security Policies:**
- Principle of least privilege for all access controls
- Regular security patching and vulnerability scanning
- Secrets management using dedicated tools (AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault)
- No hardcoded credentials in code repositories

**Access Controls:**
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) implementation as specified in AEP-3
- Multi-factor authentication for administrative access
- API rate limiting and DDoS protection
- Database access restricted to application servers only

**Compliance Standards:**
- GDPR compliance for user data handling
- OWASP Top 10 security practices implementation
- Regular security audits and penetration testing
- Encryption in transit (TLS 1.2+) and at rest (AES-256)

### OPERATIONAL REQUIREMENTS

**Monitoring:**
- Real-time application performance monitoring (APM)
- Infrastructure monitoring (CPU, memory, disk, network)
- Database performance monitoring and query optimization
- Uptime monitoring with alerting for service disruptions

**Logging:**
- Centralized logging solution (ELK stack, Splunk, or equivalent)
- Structured logging with request tracing capabilities
- Audit logs for all administrative actions and data access
- Log retention policy (30 days for development, 90 days for production)

**Backup and Disaster Recovery:**
- Automated daily database backups with point-in-time recovery
- Off-site backup storage with encryption
- Disaster recovery plan with RTO of 4 hours and RPO of 15 minutes
- Regular disaster recovery drills and testing

### INTEGRATION REQUIREMENTS

**External Systems:**
- Integration with identity providers for authentication (OAuth 2.0/OpenID Connect)
- Email service integration for notifications and password resets
- Monitoring and alerting system integration (PagerDuty, OpsGenie)

**APIs:**
- RESTful API design with versioning support
- API documentation using OpenAPI/Swagger specifications
- Rate limiting and API key management
- WebSocket support for real-time dashboard updates

**Data Migration Needs:**
- Database migration scripts with version control
- Zero-downtime database schema migration capabilities
- Data validation and integrity checks during migrations
- Rollback procedures for failed migrations

**CI/CD Pipeline Requirements:**
- Automated testing at multiple stages (unit, integration, end-to-end)
- Security scanning in pipeline (SAST, DAST, dependency scanning)
- Automated deployment to staging environment on successful builds
- Manual approval gate for production deployments
- Environment-specific configuration management

**Database Requirements:**
- PostgreSQL 13+ with connection pooling
- Database backup and restore procedures
- Performance optimization and indexing strategy
- Connection management and query timeout configurations

**Frontend Requirements:**
- CDN integration for static asset delivery
- Browser compatibility testing automation
- Bundle size optimization and lazy loading
- CSP headers and security hardening

**Authentication Requirements:**
- JWT token-based authentication with secure storage
- Token refresh mechanism implementation
- Session management and invalidation procedures
- Secure password hashing (bcrypt with appropriate work factor)

This comprehensive requirements specification ensures the AEP project will be deployed with proper infrastructure, security measures, operational capabilities, and integration points to support the features outlined in the project issues while maintaining scalability, reliability, and maintainability.

## DOCUMENT GENERATION PROMPT  

```
You are a senior DevOps architect creating a comprehensive deployment strategy document for AEP.

Based on the following requirements analysis: The AEP project requires a multi-environment infrastructure supporting Node.js backend, React frontend, and PostgreSQL database with comprehensive security, monitoring, and CI/CD capabilities. Key requirements include multi-tier architecture across development, staging, and production environments; RBAC implementation; JWT authentication; automated testing; blue-green deployment strategy; infrastructure-as-code; centralized logging; disaster recovery planning; and compliance with security standards including GDPR and OWASP Top 10.

Create a professional deployment strategy document with the following structure:
