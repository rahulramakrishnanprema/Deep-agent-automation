## DOCUMENT GENERATION PROMPT  

```
You are a senior testing architect creating a comprehensive testing strategy document for AEP.

Based on the following requirements analysis: [The AEP project requires comprehensive testing across functional, non-functional, compliance, integration, and user acceptance testing domains. Functional testing must cover authentication systems, user profile APIs, dashboard UI, role-based access control, database schema, and DevOps environment. Non-functional testing needs include performance, security, reliability, and usability testing. Compliance testing must address data protection (GDPR), security standards (OWASP Top 10, PCI DSS), and accessibility (WCAG 2.1). Integration testing should validate API integrations, system components, and data flow. User acceptance testing must verify business processes, user experience, and acceptance criteria fulfillment. The testing strategy should incorporate risk-based approaches, test automation, and CI/CD integration.]

Create a professional testing strategy document with the following structure:

# Testing Strategy Document: AEP

## 1. Executive Summary
[Provide testing overview, objectives, and key quality goals including ensuring secure authentication, reliable user profile management, responsive dashboard UI, robust role-based access control, and efficient database operations. Key quality goals: 99.9% system availability, <200ms API response times, zero critical security vulnerabilities, and full compliance with GDPR and WCAG 2.1 standards.]

## 2. Test Strategy Overview
[Describe overall testing approach using risk-based methodology, shift-left testing principles, and continuous testing integration. Testing philosophy emphasizes automation-first approach with 80% test automation coverage, comprehensive security testing, and performance benchmarking throughout development lifecycle.]

## 3. Test Planning and Scope
[Define testing scope covering all functional components (authentication, profile API, dashboard UI, RBAC, database, DevOps), non-functional aspects (performance, security, reliability), compliance requirements, and integration points. Exclude third-party integrations not specified in requirements. Testing boundaries include web applications, APIs, database, and infrastructure components.]

## 4. Test Types and Methodologies
[Detail unit testing using Jest/Pytest frameworks, integration testing with Postman/Newman, system testing with Selenium/Cypress, UAT with real user scenarios, performance testing with JMeter/Locust, security testing with OWASP ZAP/Burp Suite, accessibility testing with axe-core/WAVE, and compliance testing with specialized tools for GDPR and security standards.]

## 5. Test Environment Strategy
[Test environment setup including dedicated testing servers, staging environment mirroring production, database instances with anonymized production data, browser testing matrix (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge latest versions), mobile device testing lab, and performance testing infrastructure. Data management includes synthetic data generation, data masking, and test data refresh procedures.]

## 6. Test Case Design and Management
[Test case creation following BDD format with Gherkin syntax, test data requirements covering all scenarios including edge cases, test case management using TestRail/Xray, traceability matrix linking requirements to test cases, and test case version control integrated with Git repository.]

## 7. Test Execution Strategy
[Testing phases including unit testing during development, integration testing after feature completion, system testing in staging environment, UAT with business users, performance testing before releases, and security testing quarterly. Execution procedures include automated test suites in CI/CD, manual exploratory testing, and regression testing cycles.]

## 8. Quality Metrics and Reporting
[KPIs including test coverage (target 90%), defect density (<0.1 defects/function point), mean time to detection (<4 hours), mean time to resolution (<24 hours for critical defects). Reporting standards include daily test execution reports, weekly quality metrics dashboard, release readiness reports, and defect trend analysis.]

## 9. Risk-Based Testing Approach
[Risk assessment based on functionality criticality, security impact, and user impact. High-risk areas: authentication security, data protection, role-based access control. Priority-based testing focusing on critical functionality first, security vulnerabilities immediate attention, and compliance requirements mandatory testing.]

## 10. Test Automation Strategy
[Automation frameworks: Selenium WebDriver for UI testing, RestAssured/Requests for API testing, Jest/JUnit for unit testing, Appium for mobile testing. Tools selection based on open-source standards with Jenkins/GitLab CI for execution. Automation roadmap targeting 40% automation in first release, 60% in second, 80% by final release.]

## 11. Continuous Testing Integration
[CI/CD integration with automated test execution on every commit, quality gates requiring 80% test pass rate, security scanning in pipeline, performance regression testing nightly, and automated deployment to staging after successful tests. DevOps alignment through infrastructure-as-code testing, environment validation, and automated monitoring.]

## 12. Appendices
[Test templates including test case format, defect report template, test data templates. Checklists for release testing, security testing, accessibility testing. Tool configurations for Jest, Selenium, JMeter, OWASP ZAP. Reference materials including testing standards, compliance requirements, and industry best practices.]
