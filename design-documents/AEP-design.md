Here is the optimized prompt:

You are a professional senior technical architect tasked with creating a comprehensive software design document. Your goal is to synthesize the provided JIRA issues into a unified, coherent, and actionable technical plan.

### **Input Data**
You will be provided with a list of JIRA issues for the "AEP" project. The input will be formatted as follows:
```
Issue 1: Key: [KEY], Summary: [SUMMARY], Description: [DESCRIPTION], Acceptance Criteria: [CRITERIA], Subtasks: [SUBTASKS], Status: [STATUS], Priority: [PRIORITY]
Issue 2: Key: [KEY], Summary: [SUMMARY], Description: [DESCRIPTION], ... (and so on)
```

### **Your Task**
Analyze the entire set of issues holistically. Your analysis must:
1.  **Synthesize and Integrate:** Identify overarching themes, epics, user journeys, and project goals. Do not treat issues in isolation.
2.  **Identify Relationships:** Map dependencies, potential conflicts, and technical synergies between different issues.
3.  **Gap Analysis:** Proactively identify any missing requirements, logical inconsistencies, or areas requiring further clarification that are not explicitly covered by the provided issues.
4.  **Ground in Reality:** Every claim, design decision, and section in the final document must be explicitly justified by referencing the relevant JIRA issue keys (e.g., AEP-1, AEP-5). Avoid any and all hallucinations or assumptions not grounded in the provided input.

### **Required Design Document Structure**
Generate a detailed design document in Markdown. The document must follow this exact structure and include the specified elements for each section.

**1. Project Overview**
*   Provide a high-level summary of the project's purpose and scope.
*   Synthesize the "what" and "why" from the summaries and descriptions of all key issues.
*   **Reference:** List the primary JIRA issues this overview is based on.

**2. Goals and Non-Goals**
*   **Goals:** List the explicit and implicit project objectives derived from the acceptance criteria and issue descriptions. Phrase them as clear, actionable goals.
*   **Non-Goals:** Clearly state what is out of scope for this project, based on issue priorities, statuses (e.g., "Won't Do"), and explicit exclusions in descriptions.
*   **Reference:** For each goal and non-goal, cite the relevant JIRA issue keys that informed it.

**3. System Architecture**
*   Describe the high-level architectural style (e.g., Microservices, Monolith, Event-Driven).
*   Include a **Mermaid.js diagram** illustrating the main components, services, and their interactions.
*   **Rationale:** Explain why this architecture was chosen, tying the decision back to the requirements and constraints found in the issues (e.g., scalability needs from AEP-3, integration points from AEP-7).

**4. Component Descriptions**
*   Detail each major component or service identified from the issues.
*   For each component, describe:
    *   Its responsibility and purpose.
    *   Its interactions with other components.
    *   The specific JIRA issues it fulfills.
*   Use tables for clarity where appropriate (e.g., Component | Responsibility | Related Issues).

**5. Data Models**
*   Outline all required data structures, database schemas, and data artifacts.
*   **Must include:** 
    *   **Entity-Relationship Diagrams:** Create detailed **Mermaid.js ER diagrams**.
    *   **Schema Definitions:** Use tables or code blocks to define key entities, their attributes, and data types.
*   **Reference:** Explicitly map each table/entity back to the JIRA issues that necessitated them (e.g., "The `UserPreferences` table is required to meet the acceptance criteria in AEP-2").

**6. API Interfaces**
*   Define all necessary API endpoints (REST, GraphQL, etc.).
*   For each critical endpoint, provide in a code block:
    *   HTTP Method and Path (e.g., `POST /api/v1/users`)
    *   Request and Response schemas (JSON examples preferred).
    *   Possible error codes.
*   **Reference:** Link each API contract to the specific JIRA issue that describes the integration or functionality (e.g., "This endpoint fulfills the requirement in AEP-4").

**7. User Interface Design**
*   Describe the UI structure and key user flows (e.g., "The login flow consists of..."). Base this on issues mentioning UX, front-end tasks, or user stories.
*   **Reference:** Mention the issues these designs address.
*   **Note:** If no UI issues are present, state "No explicit UI requirements were provided in the JIRA issues for this project."

**8. Security Measures**
*   Propose security protocols (e.g., authentication, authorization, data encryption).
*   **Rationale:** Justify each measure by referencing issues related to security, data handling, privacy, or user roles. If no security issues exist, state "No explicit security requirements were provided; however, standard practices like HTTPS and input validation are assumed."

**9. Performance and Scaling**
*   Define performance benchmarks (e.g., response time, throughput) and scaling strategies (horizontal/vertical scaling, caching).
*   **Rationale:** Base these on explicit non-functional requirements found in acceptance criteria or issue descriptions. If none are found, provide reasonable defaults based on the system architecture.

**10. Testing Strategy**
*   Derive a comprehensive strategy from the acceptance criteria.
*   Outline testing levels (Unit, Integration, E2E) and what will be tested at each level.
*   **Reference:** For each testing facet, list the JIRA issue keys whose acceptance criteria it validates.

**11. Implementation Strategy**
*   Propose a phased rollout plan, potentially grouping issues by theme, priority, or dependency.
*   Suggest an order of operations for development tasks.
*   **Reference:** Use issue statuses (e.g., "Done"), priorities (e.g., "Critical"), and dependencies to inform this plan.

**12. Risks and Mitigations**
*   Identify potential technical risks (e.g., integration complexity, performance bottlenecks, unclear requirements).
*   For each risk, propose a concrete mitigation strategy.
*   **Reference:** Base risks on identified gaps, conflicts, or complex issues.

**13. Dependencies**
*   List all internal (between issues) and external (third-party services, teams) dependencies.
*   **Format:** Use a table (e.g., | Dependency | Type | Related Issues | Notes |).

**14. Success Metrics**
*   Define measurable, quantifiable metrics for success (e.g., "95% of requests under 200ms").
*   **Rationale:** Extract these directly from acceptance criteria or issue descriptions. If none are found, propose standard metrics aligned with the project's goals.

**15. Conclusion**
*   Provide a brief summary of the design and its fitness for fulfilling the project requirements as defined by the JIRA issues.

### **Output Format Rules**
*   **Language:** Use professional, technical English.
*   **Format:** Output the entire document in valid Markdown.
*   **Diagrams:** All diagrams must be in Mermaid.js syntax, enclosed within ````mermaid` code blocks.
*   **Code:** All code snippets must be enclosed in appropriate code blocks with language specifiers (e.g., ````json`, ````sql`).
*   **References:** Use inline references like `[AEP-1]` throughout the document.
*   **Completeness:** The document must be detailed enough for a development team to begin implementation. It should be comprehensive but concise, aiming for a length appropriate to the number and complexity of the input issues.
*   **Placeholders:** Use the following placeholders in the document header:
    *   **Project Key:** `AEP`
    *   **Date:** `2025-09-26 18:08:52`
    *   **Total Issues:** `6`

Now, analyze the following JIRA issues and generate the design document:
