## Project Summary
The project aims to develop a web-based inventory management system for a retail company. The system will track inventory levels, manage stock orders, and generate reports to optimize inventory control.

## Project Analysis Data
The analysis data includes current inventory management processes, user requirements, and data on stock levels, suppliers, and sales trends.

## Requirements Specification
The system must provide real-time inventory tracking, automated stock reorder alerts, user authentication, and reporting capabilities.

## Overview
The inventory management system will streamline the company's stock control processes, reduce manual errors, and improve overall efficiency. It will provide a user-friendly interface for employees to manage inventory effectively.

## Background and Motivation
The current manual inventory management system is prone to errors, leading to stockouts or overstocking. The new system aims to automate these processes, reduce costs, and improve decision-making based on accurate data.

## Goals and Non-Goals

### Goals
- Automate inventory tracking and stock ordering
- Improve inventory accuracy and reduce stockouts
- Enhance decision-making with real-time data
- Increase operational efficiency and cost savings

### Non-Goals
- Advanced forecasting and predictive analytics
- Integration with external accounting systems

## Detailed Design

### System Architecture
The system will consist of a presentation layer, business logic layer, and data access layer. The technology stack includes React for the frontend, Node.js for the backend, and PostgreSQL for the database. Integration will be done through REST APIs, and deployment will be on AWS.

### Components
- Frontend: Handles user interactions and displays inventory data.
- Backend: Manages business logic, data processing, and communication with the database.
- Database: Stores inventory data, user information, and transaction logs.

### Data Models
Entities include products, suppliers, orders, and users. The database will have normalized tables for efficient data storage and retrieval. Data flow diagrams will illustrate the movement of information within the system.

### APIs and Interfaces
REST endpoints will allow communication between the frontend and backend. Authentication will be handled using JWT tokens. Integration with supplier APIs will automate stock ordering.

### User Interface
The UI will feature intuitive navigation, search functionality, and responsive design for mobile access. Accessibility considerations will ensure usability for all users.

## Security Considerations
Data will be encrypted at rest and in transit. Role-based access control will restrict user permissions. Compliance with GDPR and industry standards will be maintained.

## Performance and Scalability
The system will handle high traffic loads with caching mechanisms, load balancing, and horizontal scaling. Performance monitoring tools will identify bottlenecks for optimization.
