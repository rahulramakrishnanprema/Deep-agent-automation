## Project Summary
The project aims to develop a web-based inventory management system for a retail company. The system will allow users to track inventory levels, manage orders, and generate reports to optimize stock levels and improve overall efficiency.

## Project Analysis Data
The data for this project includes information on product inventory, sales orders, customer details, and supplier information. This data will be used to create a centralized system for managing all aspects of the retail company's inventory.

## Requirements Specification
The requirements for the project include the ability to:
- Track product inventory levels in real-time
- Manage incoming and outgoing orders
- Generate reports on sales trends and stock levels
- Integrate with existing accounting software
- Provide user roles and permissions for secure access

## Overview
The project aims to address the inefficiencies in the current manual inventory management process by providing a centralized system for tracking inventory levels, managing orders, and generating reports. This system will improve accuracy, reduce stockouts, and streamline operations for the retail company.

## Background and Motivation
The project is needed to solve the challenges faced by the retail company in managing their inventory effectively. The current manual process is prone to errors, leading to stockouts or overstock situations. By implementing an automated inventory management system, the company can improve inventory accuracy, reduce costs, and enhance customer satisfaction.

## Goals and Non-Goals

### Goals
- Improve inventory accuracy and reduce stockouts
- Streamline order management processes
- Increase operational efficiency
- Provide real-time visibility into inventory levels
- Integrate with existing accounting software

### Non-Goals
- Implementing advanced forecasting algorithms
- Integrating with third-party logistics providers
- Developing a mobile application for inventory management

## Detailed Design

### System Architecture
The system will consist of a web-based application with the following layers:
- Presentation layer: React.js for the frontend
- Application layer: Node.js for the backend
- Data layer: PostgreSQL database
- Integration with accounting software via REST APIs
- Deployment on AWS using Docker containers

### Components
- Inventory Management Module: Responsible for tracking inventory levels and managing orders
- Reporting Module: Generates reports on sales trends and stock levels
- User Management Module: Manages user roles and permissions

### Data Models
- Product: Contains information on product details, such as name, price, and quantity
- Order: Tracks incoming and outgoing orders
- Customer: Stores customer details for order fulfillment

### APIs and Interfaces
- REST endpoints for interacting with the system
- Authentication using JWT tokens
- Integration with accounting software via REST APIs

### Security Considerations
- Data encryption at rest and in transit
- Role-based access control for user permissions
- Compliance with GDPR regulations

### Performance and Scalability
- Load balancing using AWS Elastic Load Balancer
- Caching with Redis for improved performance
- Horizontal scaling with Kubernetes for handling increased traffic
