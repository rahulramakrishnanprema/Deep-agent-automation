## Project Summary
The project aims to develop a web-based inventory management system for a retail company to streamline their inventory tracking, ordering, and reporting processes.

## Project Analysis Data
The project data includes information about the current inventory management system, user requirements, business processes, and data flow within the organization.

## Requirements Specification
The requirements specify the need for real-time inventory updates, automated reordering based on stock levels, user roles and permissions, reporting capabilities, and integration with existing systems.

## Overview
The project involves building a modern inventory management system to improve efficiency, accuracy, and decision-making for the retail company. It will automate manual tasks, provide real-time insights, and enhance inventory control.

## Background and Motivation
The current manual inventory management system is error-prone, time-consuming, and lacks real-time visibility. The new system will address these issues by providing accurate data, automating processes, and improving decision-making.

## Goals and Non-Goals

### Goals
- Automate inventory tracking and reordering
- Improve data accuracy and reporting
- Enhance user productivity and decision-making

### Non-Goals
- Advanced forecasting capabilities
- Integration with external suppliers

## Detailed Design

### System Architecture
The system will consist of a presentation layer, application layer, and data layer. The technology stack includes React for the frontend, Node.js for the backend, and PostgreSQL for the database. Integration will be achieved through REST APIs, and deployment will be on AWS.

### Components
- Frontend: Responsible for user interaction and presentation
- Backend: Manages business logic and data processing
- Database: Stores inventory data and transactions

### Data Models
Entities include products, orders, users, and suppliers. The database design will follow normalized schemas to ensure data integrity and efficiency.

### APIs and Interfaces
REST endpoints will handle CRUD operations for products, orders, and users. Authentication will be implemented using JWT tokens, and external integrations will follow industry standards.

### User Interface
The UI will feature intuitive navigation, responsive design, and accessibility features to cater to a diverse user base.

## Security Considerations
Data will be encrypted at rest and in transit. Role-based access control will restrict user permissions, and compliance with GDPR and PCI DSS will be ensured.

## Performance and Scalability
The system will handle high loads with caching mechanisms, load balancing, and horizontal scaling. Performance bottlenecks will be identified and optimized for optimal user experience.
