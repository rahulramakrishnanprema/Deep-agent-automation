## Detailed Design

### System Architecture
The AI Task Agent System will consist of:
- Presentation layer: Web-based interface for users to interact with the system
- Application layer: AI algorithms for task recommendations and reminders
- Data layer: Database for storing user tasks and preferences
- Technology stack: Node.js for backend, React for frontend, MongoDB for database
- Deployment architecture: Cloud-based deployment for scalability

### Components
- Task Management Module: Responsible for CRUD operations on tasks
- Recommendation Engine: Analyzes user behavior to suggest tasks
- Reminder Service: Sends notifications for upcoming tasks
- Database: Stores user tasks and preferences

### Data Models
- User: Contains user information
- Task: Represents a task with attributes like title, description, due date
- UserTask: Links users to their tasks
- Database design: NoSQL schema for flexibility in task structures

### APIs and Interfaces
- REST endpoints for task management operations
- Authentication using JWT tokens
- Integration with external calendar services for reminders

### User Interface
- Intuitive task list view with categorization options
- Drag-and-drop functionality for task prioritization
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop use

## Security Considerations
- Data encryption for user privacy
- Role-based access control for task management
- Compliance with GDPR regulations for data protection

## Performance and Scalability
