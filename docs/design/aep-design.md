## Project Summary
The project aims to develop a web-based inventory management system for a retail company. The system will allow users to track inventory levels, manage stock orders, and generate reports on sales and stock movement.

## Project Analysis Data
The analysis data includes the current inventory management process, user requirements, and system constraints. This data will drive the design and development of the new system.

## Requirements Specification
The requirements specify the need for real-time inventory tracking, user authentication, reporting capabilities, and integration with existing systems.

## Overview
The project involves creating a modern inventory management system to streamline operations, improve accuracy, and provide valuable insights for decision-making. The system will enhance efficiency and reduce manual errors in managing inventory.

## Background and Motivation
The current manual inventory management process is time-consuming, error-prone, and lacks real-time visibility. The new system will automate tasks, improve data accuracy, and provide timely information for better decision-making.

## Goals and Non-Goals

### Goals
- Automate inventory tracking and management processes
- Improve data accuracy and real-time visibility
- Enhance decision-making with insightful reports
- Increase operational efficiency and reduce errors

### Non-Goals
- Advanced forecasting capabilities
- Integration with third-party logistics providers

## Detailed Design

### System Architecture
The system will be built using a microservices architecture with separate layers for presentation, business logic, and data storage. The technology stack includes Node.js for backend services, React for the frontend, and MongoDB for the database. Deployment will be on AWS using Docker containers.

### Components
- Inventory Management Service: Responsible for tracking inventory levels and managing stock orders.
- Reporting Service: Generates reports on sales, stock movement, and inventory trends.
- User Management Service: Handles user authentication and access control.

### Data Models
The database will include tables for products, orders, users, and transactions. Entity relationships will be established to maintain data integrity. Data flow diagrams will illustrate how information flows through the system.

### APIs and Interfaces
REST endpoints will be used for communication between services. Request payloads will include data for creating, updating, and querying inventory information. Authentication will be handled using JWT tokens. Integration with external systems will be through secure APIs.

### User Interface
The UI will feature intuitive navigation, responsive design for mobile devices, and accessibility features for users with disabilities.

## Security Considerations
Data will be encrypted at rest and in transit to protect sensitive information. Access control will be implemented based on user roles and permissions. The system will comply with relevant data protection regulations.

## Performance and Scalability
The system will be designed to handle high loads with caching mechanisms, load balancing, and horizontal scaling. Performance bottlenecks will be identified and optimized to ensure optimal system performance.
