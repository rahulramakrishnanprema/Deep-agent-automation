Thank you for providing the detailed design document. It covers all the essential aspects of the software project and will serve as a valuable technical specification for the development team. The outlined architecture, implementation strategy, testing approach, risk mitigation, dependencies, timeline, and success metrics provide a clear roadmap for the project's successful completion. The document is well-structured and informative, making it easy for both technical and non-technical stakeholders to understand the project's objectives and deliverables. Great job!
