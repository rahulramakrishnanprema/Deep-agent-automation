## Project Summary
The project aims to develop a web-based inventory management system for a retail company. The system will track inventory levels, sales data, and generate reports to help with decision-making and stock management.

## Project Analysis Data
The analysis data includes current inventory management processes, data on sales trends, and user feedback on the existing system's limitations.

## Requirements Specification
The system should allow users to:
- Add, update, and delete products
- Track inventory levels in real-time
- Generate sales reports
- Set alerts for low stock levels
- Integrate with the company's accounting software

## Overview
The project involves developing a comprehensive inventory management system to streamline operations and improve decision-making for the retail company. The system will provide real-time data on inventory levels, sales trends, and generate reports to optimize stock management.

## Background and Motivation
The current manual inventory management process is time-consuming and error-prone, leading to stockouts and overstock situations. The new system aims to automate these processes, reduce human error, and provide accurate data for better decision-making.

## Goals and Non-Goals

### Goals
- Automate inventory management processes
- Improve decision-making with real-time data
- Reduce stockouts and overstock situations
- Integrate with accounting software for seamless operations

### Non-Goals
- Advanced forecasting capabilities
- Integration with third-party logistics providers

## Detailed Design

### System Architecture
The system will consist of a front-end web application, a back-end server, and a database. The technology stack includes React for the front-end, Node.js for the back-end, and PostgreSQL for the database. The system will be deployed on AWS using Docker containers.

### Components
- Front-end: Responsible for user interactions and data presentation
- Back-end: Handles business logic, data processing, and integration with external systems
- Database: Stores product information, inventory levels, and sales data

### Data Models
The database will include tables for products, inventory levels, sales transactions, and user information. Entity relationships will be established to ensure data integrity and consistency.

### APIs and Interfaces
REST endpoints will be used for communication between the front-end and back-end. Authentication will be implemented using JWT tokens. Integration with the accounting software will be through a secure API.

### User Interface
The UI will feature a dashboard displaying key metrics, a product management interface, and a reporting module. The design will be responsive and accessible to users on different devices.

## Security Considerations
- Data will be encrypted at rest and in transit
- Role-based access control will be implemented
- Compliance with GDPR and PCI DSS standards

## Performance and Scalability
- The system should handle a high volume of transactions
- Caching and load balancing will be used to improve performance
- Horizontal scaling will be implemented for scalability
