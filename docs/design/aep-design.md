## Project Summary
The project aims to develop a web-based inventory management system for a retail company to streamline their inventory tracking, ordering, and reporting processes.

## Project Analysis Data
The project data includes information on the current inventory management system, user requirements, data flow diagrams, and system constraints.

## Requirements Specification
The requirements specification outlines the need for real-time inventory updates, user authentication, reporting capabilities, and integration with existing systems.

## Overview
The project involves building a modern inventory management system that will provide real-time visibility into stock levels, automate ordering processes, and generate insightful reports for decision-making.

## Background and Motivation
The current manual inventory management system is prone to errors, leading to stockouts and overstock situations. The new system aims to improve accuracy, efficiency, and decision-making by providing real-time data and automation capabilities.

## Goals and Non-Goals

### Goals
- Implement real-time inventory updates
- Automate ordering processes
- Improve reporting capabilities
- Increase operational efficiency and accuracy

### Non-Goals
- Advanced forecasting capabilities
- Integration with third-party logistics providers

## Detailed Design

### System Architecture
The system will consist of a presentation layer, application layer, and data layer. The technology stack includes React for the frontend, Node.js for the backend, and PostgreSQL for the database. Integration will be achieved through REST APIs, and deployment will be on AWS using Docker containers.

### Components
- Inventory Management Component: Responsible for tracking stock levels and generating alerts.
- Order Management Component: Manages order processing and supplier communication.
- Reporting Component: Generates various reports based on inventory data.

### Data Models
The database will include tables for products, suppliers, orders, and transactions. Entity relationships will be established to ensure data integrity, and data flow diagrams will illustrate the movement of information within the system.

### APIs and Interfaces
REST endpoints will be used for communication between components, with authentication and authorization mechanisms in place. External system integrations will follow industry best practices for security and data protection.

### User Interface
The UI will feature intuitive user flows, responsive design for mobile access, and accessibility considerations for users with disabilities.

## Security Considerations
Data will be encrypted at rest and in transit, access control will be role-based, and compliance with relevant standards such as GDPR will be ensured.

## Performance and Scalability
Performance goals include sub-second response times, with scaling strategies involving caching, load balancing, and horizontal scaling. Bottlenecks will be identified and optimized for optimal performance.
