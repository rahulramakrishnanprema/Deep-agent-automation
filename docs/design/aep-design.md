The data also highlights the need for a centralized system to improve inventory accuracy, reduce costs, and enhance overall operational efficiency.

## Requirements Specification
The requirements specify the need for a user-friendly interface, real-time data updates, integration with existing systems, and robust security features. Key features include inventory tracking, order management, reporting capabilities, and user access control.

## Overview
The inventory management system will serve as a centralized platform for the retail company to efficiently track, manage, and report on their inventory. It aims to automate manual processes, reduce errors, and improve overall inventory visibility for better decision-making.

## Background and Motivation
The project is needed to address the current challenges faced by the retail company in managing their inventory effectively. By implementing a robust inventory management system, the company can reduce stockouts, optimize inventory levels, and improve order processing efficiency. This will lead to cost savings, improved customer satisfaction, and better business performance.

## Goals and Non-Goals

### Goals
- Automate inventory tracking and order management processes
- Improve inventory accuracy and reduce stockouts
- Enhance reporting capabilities for better decision-making
- Increase operational efficiency and reduce costs

### Non-Goals
- Advanced forecasting and demand planning features
- Integration with third-party logistics providers
- Mobile application development

## Detailed Design

### System Architecture
The system will be built using a microservices architecture with separate layers for presentation, business logic, and data access. The technology stack will include Node.js for backend services, React for the frontend, and MongoDB for the database. Integration will be achieved through RESTful APIs, and deployment will be on AWS using containers.

### Components
- Inventory Management Module: Responsible for tracking stock levels, receiving orders, and updating inventory data.
- Order Management Module: Handles order processing, fulfillment, and tracking.
- Reporting Module: Generates detailed reports on inventory levels, order history, and sales data.

### Data Models
- Entity Relationships: Inventory items linked to suppliers, orders linked to customers.
- Database Design: Normalized schema for efficient data storage and retrieval.
- Data Flow Diagrams: Illustrate the flow of data between components and external systems.

### APIs and Interfaces
- RESTful Endpoints: Expose endpoints for inventory management, order processing, and reporting.
- Payloads: JSON payloads for request and response data.
- Authentication: Implement JWT token-based authentication for secure access.
- Integrations: Integrate with payment gateways and ERP systems.

### User Interface
The UI will feature a clean and intuitive design with easy navigation, responsive layouts, and accessibility features. User flows will be optimized for efficient inventory tracking, order processing, and report generation.

## Security Considerations
- Data Protection: Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit.
- Access Control: Implement role-based access control to restrict user permissions.
- Compliance: Ensure compliance with GDPR and PCI DSS standards for data security.

## Performance and Scalability
- Performance Goals: Aim for sub-second response times for critical operations.
- Scaling Strategies: Implement caching for frequently accessed data, load balancing for high traffic, and horizontal scaling for increased demand.
- Optimization: Identify and address potential bottlenecks through profiling and optimization techniques.
