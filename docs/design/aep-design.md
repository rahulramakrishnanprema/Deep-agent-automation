### Document ID: 12345

## Project Summary
The project aims to develop a web-based inventory management system for a retail company to streamline their inventory tracking, ordering, and reporting processes.

## Project Analysis Data
The analysis data includes the current manual inventory management system, the volume of products, suppliers, and orders, as well as the reporting requirements of the company.

## Requirements Specification
The requirements include real-time inventory updates, order tracking, supplier management, reporting capabilities, user authentication, and role-based access control.

## Overview
The project involves building a robust inventory management system that will automate manual processes, improve efficiency, and provide accurate data for decision-making.

## Background and Motivation
The project is needed to address the inefficiencies and inaccuracies in the current manual inventory management system. By automating processes and providing real-time data, the system will help the company reduce stockouts, optimize inventory levels, and improve overall operations.

## Goals and Non-Goals

### Goals
- Automate inventory tracking and ordering processes
- Provide real-time updates on inventory levels
- Improve reporting capabilities for better decision-making

### Non-Goals
- Advanced forecasting and predictive analytics
- Integration with external accounting systems

## Detailed Design

### System Architecture
The system will consist of a presentation layer, business logic layer, and data access layer. The technology stack includes React for the frontend, Node.js for the backend, and PostgreSQL for the database. Integration will be achieved through REST APIs, and deployment will be on AWS using Docker containers.

### Components
- Frontend: Responsible for user interaction and presentation
- Backend: Manages business logic and data processing
- Database: Stores all inventory, order, and supplier data

### Data Models
Entities include products, orders, suppliers, and users. The database will be normalized to ensure data integrity and efficient querying. Data flow diagrams will illustrate the movement of data within the system.

### APIs and Interfaces
REST endpoints will be used for communication between frontend and backend components. Authentication will be handled using JWT tokens, and external system integrations will follow industry standards.

### User Interface
The UI will be designed for ease of use, with intuitive user flows, responsive design for different devices, and considerations for accessibility.

## Security Considerations
Data will be encrypted at rest and in transit. Access control will be role-based, and compliance with GDPR and other regulations will be ensured.

## Performance and Scalability
The system will be designed to handle a high volume of transactions. Caching, load balancing, and horizontal scaling will be implemented to ensure performance under load.
