## Project Summary
The project aims to develop a web-based inventory management system for a retail company to streamline their inventory tracking, ordering, and reporting processes. The system will allow users to manage product information, track stock levels, generate purchase orders, and analyze sales data.

## Project Analysis Data
The analysis data includes the current inventory management process, user requirements, and business objectives. It also includes data on the volume of products, suppliers, and sales transactions to be managed by the system.

## Requirements Specification
The requirements specify the need for a user-friendly interface, real-time inventory updates, integration with existing systems, and customizable reporting capabilities. The system should support multiple user roles with varying levels of access and provide alerts for low stock levels.

## Overview
The inventory management system will provide a centralized platform for the retail company to efficiently manage their inventory, reduce stockouts, and improve decision-making based on real-time data. It aims to automate manual processes, increase operational efficiency, and enhance overall inventory control.

## Background and Motivation
The project is needed to address the inefficiencies and inaccuracies in the current manual inventory management process. By implementing a digital solution, the company can reduce human errors, optimize inventory levels, and improve customer satisfaction through timely order fulfillment.

## Goals and Non-Goals

### Goals
- Implement a user-friendly inventory management system
- Enable real-time tracking of stock levels and sales data
- Improve inventory accuracy and reduce stockouts
- Enhance decision-making through customizable reports

### Non-Goals
- Advanced forecasting and predictive analytics
- Integration with third-party logistics providers
- Mobile application development

## Detailed Design

### System Architecture
The system will be built using a microservices architecture with separate modules for product management, order processing, and reporting. It will utilize a technology stack including Node.js, React, and MongoDB. Integration will be achieved through REST APIs, and deployment will be on AWS using Docker containers.

### Components
- Product Management: Responsible for adding, updating, and deleting product information.
- Order Processing: Manages purchase orders, sales orders, and stock adjustments.
- Reporting: Generates customizable reports on sales, inventory levels, and supplier performance.

### Data Models
The system will include entities for products, suppliers, orders, and users. Database design will follow normalized schemas to ensure data integrity and efficient querying. Data flow diagrams will illustrate the movement of data between components.

### APIs and Interfaces
REST endpoints will be used for communication between components, with JSON payloads for requests and responses. Authentication will be implemented using JWT tokens, and integration with external systems will follow industry-standard protocols.

### User Interface
The UI will feature intuitive navigation, responsive design for mobile devices, and accessibility features for users with disabilities. User flows will be optimized for efficient data entry and retrieval.

## Security Considerations
Security measures will include data encryption at rest and in transit, role-based access control, and compliance with GDPR regulations. Regular security audits and penetration testing will be conducted to identify and address vulnerabilities.

## Performance and Scalability
Performance goals include sub-second response times for critical operations and support for thousands of concurrent users. Caching mechanisms, load balancers, and horizontal scaling will be implemented to handle increased traffic and ensure system reliability.
