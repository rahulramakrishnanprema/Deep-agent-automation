# Project Title: AI Task Agent System

## Project Summary
The AI Task Agent System is a software project aimed at developing an intelligent task management system that utilizes artificial intelligence to automate task assignment, tracking, and prioritization. The system will streamline task management processes and improve overall productivity within organizations.

## Requirements Specification
The requirements for the AI Task Agent System include:
- Ability to assign tasks to team members based on workload and skillset
- Automated task prioritization based on deadlines and dependencies
- Real-time task tracking and progress monitoring
- Integration with existing project management tools
- User-friendly interface for easy task management

## Authors
- AI Task Agent System

## Overview
The AI Task Agent System is designed to revolutionize task management within organizations by leveraging artificial intelligence to automate and optimize task assignment, tracking, and prioritization. By intelligently allocating tasks based on workload and skillset, the system aims to improve efficiency and productivity.

## Background and Motivation
The AI Task Agent System is needed to address the inefficiencies and challenges associated with manual task management processes. By automating task assignment and prioritization, the system will help organizations streamline their workflows, reduce errors, and improve overall productivity.

## Goals and Non-Goals

### Goals
- Automate task assignment and prioritization
- Improve efficiency and productivity
- Seamless integration with existing project management tools

### Non-Goals
- Advanced machine learning algorithms (deferred for future improvements)
- Integration with non-standard project management tools

## Detailed Design

### System Architecture
The system will consist of application layers for task management, AI algorithms, and user interface. The technology stack will include Python for AI, React for the UI, and PostgreSQL for the database. Integration will be through REST APIs, and deployment will be on cloud servers.

### Components
- Task Management: Responsible for task assignment and tracking
- AI Algorithms: Responsible for task prioritization
- User Interface: Allows users to interact with the system

### Data Models
- Task: Contains task details and status
- User: Contains user information and skillset
- Team: Contains team information and workload

### APIs and Interfaces
- REST endpoints for task management operations
- Authentication using JWT tokens
- Integration with project management tools via webhooks

### User Interface
- Intuitive design for task management
- Responsive layout for desktop and mobile
- Accessibility features for users with disabilities

## Security Considerations
