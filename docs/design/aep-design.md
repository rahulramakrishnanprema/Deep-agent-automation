### Document ID: 001

## Project Summary
The project aims to develop a web-based inventory management system for a retail company to streamline their inventory tracking, ordering, and reporting processes.

## Project Analysis Data
The project data includes information on the current inventory management system, the volume of products, sales data, and user roles within the organization.

## Requirements Specification
The requirements specify the need for real-time inventory updates, automated reordering based on stock levels, user roles for different access levels, and reporting capabilities.

## Overview
The project involves creating a user-friendly system that enables efficient inventory management, reduces manual errors, and provides insights through reporting.

## Background and Motivation
The current manual inventory management system is prone to errors and inefficiencies, leading to stockouts or overstock situations. The new system aims to automate processes, improve accuracy, and provide timely insights for better decision-making.

## Goals and Non-Goals

### Goals
- Automate inventory tracking and reordering processes
- Improve accuracy and efficiency in inventory management
- Provide real-time reporting for better decision-making

### Non-Goals
- Advanced forecasting capabilities
- Integration with external accounting systems

## Detailed Design

### System Architecture
The system will consist of a frontend web application, backend server, and database. The technology stack includes React for the frontend, Node.js for the backend, and PostgreSQL for the database. Integration will be through REST APIs, and deployment will be on AWS.

### Components
- Frontend: Responsible for user interaction and data presentation
- Backend: Handles business logic, data processing, and communication with the database
- Database: Stores product information, stock levels, and user data

### Data Models
The database will have tables for products, orders, users, and roles. Entity relationships will ensure data integrity, and data flow diagrams will illustrate information flow within the system.

### APIs and Interfaces
REST endpoints will facilitate communication between the frontend and backend. Authentication will be handled using JWT tokens, and external integrations will follow industry standards.

### User Interface
The UI will focus on intuitive navigation, clear data visualization, and responsive design for various devices.

## Security Considerations
Data will be encrypted at rest and in transit. Access control will be role-based, and compliance with data protection regulations will be ensured.

## Performance and Scalability
The system will be designed to handle high loads with caching mechanisms, load balancing, and horizontal scaling options. Performance bottlenecks will be identified and optimized.
