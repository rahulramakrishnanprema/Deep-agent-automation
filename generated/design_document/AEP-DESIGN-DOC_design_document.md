**PROJECT OVERVIEW**
======================

The AEP (Advanced Education Platform) project aims to design and develop a comprehensive education platform that provides a personalized learning experience for users. The platform will offer a range of features, including user profile management, role-based access control, authentication, and a dashboard for users to track their progress.

The business context for this project is to create a scalable and secure platform that can support a large number of users and provide a seamless learning experience. The platform will be designed to meet the needs of various stakeholders, including administrators, instructors, and learners.

**REQUIREMENTS ANALYSIS**
========================

The requirements for the AEP project are divided into several issues, each addressing a specific aspect of the platform. The issues are:

* Issue AEP-6: DevOps & Environment Setup (Infra Story)
* Issue AEP-5: Basic User Dashboard UI
* Issue AEP-4: Basic User Profile API
* Issue AEP-3: Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
* Issue AEP-2: Implement Authentication APIs
* Issue AEP-1: Setup Database Schema

The functional requirements for the platform include:

* User profile management
* Role-based access control
* Authentication and authorization
* Dashboard for users to track their progress
* Integration with a database management system

The non-functional requirements for the platform include:

* Scalability: The platform should be able to support a large number of users and handle increased traffic.
* Security: The platform should ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of user data.
* Usability: The platform should provide an intuitive and user-friendly interface for users.
* Performance: The platform should respond quickly to user requests and provide a seamless learning experience.

**SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE**
======================

The system architecture for the AEP project will consist of the following components:

* Frontend: The frontend will be built using a JavaScript framework (React) and will provide a user-friendly interface for users to interact with the platform.
* Backend: The backend will be built using a Node.js framework (Express) and will handle requests from the frontend, interact with the database, and provide APIs for the frontend to consume.
* Database: The database will be designed using a relational database management system (PostgreSQL) and will store user data, course information, and other relevant data.
* Authentication: The authentication system will be built using a library (Passport.js) and will handle user authentication and authorization.
* CI/CD Pipeline: The CI/CD pipeline will be built using a tool (Jenkins) and will automate the build, test, and deployment process for the platform.

The system architecture will be designed to be scalable, secure, and highly available. The platform will be deployed on a cloud provider (AWS) and will use a load balancer to distribute traffic across multiple instances.
