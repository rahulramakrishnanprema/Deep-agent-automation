**AEP-DESIGN-DOC: Technical Design Document for AEP**
=====================================================

### 1. PROJECT OVERVIEW

The AEP project aims to provide a personalized dashboard for users, accessible after secure login. This document outlines the technical design for implementing authentication APIs, ensuring secure and efficient user authentication.

The project's primary objective is to create a robust authentication system, issuing JSON Web Tokens (JWT) or session tokens after successful authentication. The system will handle invalid login attempts, returning informative error messages. Additionally, the project will include comprehensive unit testing to ensure the API's reliability and performance.

### 2. REQUIREMENTS ANALYSIS

The requirements for the AEP project are centered around implementing authentication APIs. The key requirements are:

*   **Login and Registration APIs**: Create APIs for user login and registration, enabling users to access their personalized dashboard securely.
*   **JWT/Session Token Issuance**: Issue JWT or session tokens after successful authentication, ensuring secure and efficient user authentication.
*   **Invalid Login Attempt Handling**: Return informative error messages for invalid login attempts, enhancing user experience and security.
*   **Unit Testing**: Ensure the API passes comprehensive unit tests, guaranteeing its reliability and performance.

The acceptance criteria for the project include:

*   Successful creation of login and registration APIs
*   Issuance of JWT or session tokens after authentication
*   Handling of invalid login attempts with error messages
*   Passing of unit tests for the API

The subtasks for the project are:

1.  **Create Login API**: Design and implement a secure login API, enabling users to access their dashboard.
2.  **Create Registration API**: Develop a registration API, allowing new users to create accounts and access the dashboard.
3.  **Implement JWT/Session Handling**: Integrate JWT or session token handling, ensuring secure and efficient user authentication.
4.  **Write API Test Cases**: Create comprehensive test cases for the API, ensuring its reliability and performance.

### 3. SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE

The system architecture for the AEP project will consist of the following components:

*   **Frontend**: A user-facing interface, responsible for handling user input and displaying the personalized dashboard.
*   **Backend**: A server-side application, responsible for handling authentication, API requests, and data storage.
*   **Database**: A data storage system, responsible for storing user information and dashboard data.

The system will utilize a microservices architecture, with separate services for authentication, API handling, and data storage. This architecture will enable scalability, flexibility, and maintainability.

The authentication service will handle user authentication, issuing JWT or session tokens after successful authentication. The API handling service will manage API requests, routing them to the appropriate services. The data storage service will store user information and dashboard data, ensuring data consistency and integrity.

### 4. DETAILED DESIGN SPECIFICATIONS

#### 4.1 Authentication Service

The authentication service will be responsible for handling user authentication. The service will utilize a combination of username and password authentication, with optional two-factor authentication.

The authentication service will consist of the following components:

*   **Authentication Controller**: Handles user authentication requests, verifying user credentials and issuing JWT or session tokens.
*   **User Repository**: Stores user information, including usernames, passwords, and authentication data.
*   **Authentication Manager**: Manages authentication logic, including password hashing and verification.

The authentication service will utilize the following algorithms and protocols:

*   **Password Hashing**: Utilize a secure password hashing algorithm, such as bcrypt or Argon2, to store user passwords securely.
*   **JWT/Session Token Issuance**: Issue JWT or session tokens after successful authentication, utilizing a secure token issuance protocol.

#### 4.2 API Handling Service

The API handling service will be responsible for managing API requests, routing them to the appropriate services. The service will consist of the following components:

*   **API Gateway**: Handles incoming API requests, routing them to the appropriate services.
*   **API Router**: Routes API requests to the appropriate services, based on the request URL and method.
*   **Service Proxy**: Acts as a proxy for the services, handling requests and responses.

The API handling service will utilize the following protocols and algorithms:

*   **HTTP/HTTPS**: Utilize HTTP or HTTPS protocols for API requests and responses.
*   **API Key Authentication**: Utilize API key authentication for secure API access.

#### 4.3 Data Storage Service

The data storage service will be responsible for storing user information and dashboard data. The service will consist of the following components:

*   **Database**: Stores user information and dashboard data, utilizing a relational or NoSQL database management system.
*   **Data Access Object**: Provides a layer of abstraction for data access, utilizing a data access object (DAO) pattern.
*   **Data Repository**: Stores and retrieves data, utilizing a data repository pattern.

The data storage service will utilize the following algorithms and protocols:

*   **Data Encryption**: Utilize data encryption algorithms, such as AES or SSL/TLS, to store data securely.
*   **Data Backup and Recovery**: Utilize data backup and recovery mechanisms, such as database replication or backups, to ensure data integrity and availability.
