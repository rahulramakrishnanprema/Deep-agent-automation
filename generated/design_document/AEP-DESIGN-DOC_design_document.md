**AEP-DESIGN-DOC: Technical Design Document for AEP**
=====================================================

### 1. **PROJECT OVERVIEW**

The AEP project aims to provide a personalized dashboard for users, accessible through a secure login system. The primary goal is to design and implement a robust authentication mechanism, ensuring the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of user data. This document outlines the technical design and implementation plan for the AEP project, focusing on the authentication APIs and related components.

In the context of the AEP project, the authentication system plays a critical role in ensuring the security and integrity of user data. The system will provide a secure login and registration process, issuing JSON Web Tokens (JWT) or session tokens to authenticated users. The authentication APIs will be designed to handle invalid login attempts, returning error messages to prevent brute-force attacks.

The business context of the AEP project requires a scalable and maintainable architecture, capable of handling a large number of users and requests. The system will be designed to ensure high availability, with minimal downtime and efficient error handling.

### 2. **REQUIREMENTS ANALYSIS**

The AEP project has the following functional and non-functional requirements:

**Functional Requirements:**

* Implement authentication APIs for login and registration
* Issue JWT or session tokens after successful authentication
* Handle invalid login attempts and return error messages
* Pass unit tests for API validation

**Non-Functional Requirements:**

* Scalability: The system should be able to handle a large number of users and requests
* Availability: The system should ensure high availability, with minimal downtime
* Security: The system should ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of user data
* Performance: The system should respond to requests within a reasonable time frame
* Maintainability: The system should be easy to maintain and update

The requirements analysis has identified the following key stakeholders:

* Users: The primary stakeholders, who will interact with the system through the login and registration APIs
* Developers: The secondary stakeholders, who will develop and maintain the system
* Administrators: The tertiary stakeholders, who will monitor and manage the system

### 3. **SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE**

The AEP system will consist of the following high-level components:

* **Authentication Service**: Responsible for handling login and registration requests, issuing JWT or session tokens, and validating user credentials
* **User Management Service**: Responsible for managing user data, including user profiles and preferences
* **Dashboard Service**: Responsible for providing personalized dashboards to authenticated users
* **API Gateway**: Responsible for routing incoming requests to the appropriate services
* **Database**: Responsible for storing user data, including credentials and profiles

The system architecture will be based on a microservices design pattern, with each component communicating through RESTful APIs. The authentication service will be designed to handle high traffic and will be scaled horizontally to ensure high availability.

The system will use a load balancer to distribute incoming traffic across multiple instances of the authentication service. The load balancer will be configured to use a round-robin algorithm, ensuring that each instance receives an equal number of requests.

### 4. **DETAILED DESIGN SPECIFICATIONS**

#### 4.1 **Authentication Service**

The authentication service will be responsible for handling login and registration requests. The service will use a combination of username and password authentication, with optional two-factor authentication.

* **Login API**:
	+ Endpoint: `/login`
	+ Method: `POST`
	+ Request Body: `username`, `password`
	+ Response: `JWT` or `session token`
* **Registration API**:
	+ Endpoint: `/register`
	+ Method: `POST`
	+ Request Body: `username`, `password`, `email`
	+ Response: `JWT` or `session token`

The authentication service will use a password hashing algorithm (e.g., bcrypt) to store user passwords securely. The service will also implement rate limiting to prevent brute-force attacks.

The authentication service will be designed to handle invalid login attempts, returning error messages to prevent brute-force attacks. The service will use a combination of IP blocking and rate limiting to prevent attacks.

#### 4.2 **User Management Service**

The user management service will be responsible for managing user data, including user profiles and preferences.

* **User Profile API**:
	+ Endpoint: `/users/{username}`
	+ Method: `GET`
	+ Response: `user profile data`
* **User Preferences API**:
	+ Endpoint: `/users/{username}/preferences`
	+ Method: `GET`
	+ Response: `user preferences data`

The user management service will use a database to store user data, with indexing and caching to improve performance.

#### 4.3 **Dashboard Service**

The dashboard service will be responsible for providing personalized dashboards to authenticated users.

* **Dashboard API**:
	+ Endpoint: `/dashboard`
	+ Method: `GET`
	+ Response: `dashboard data`

The dashboard service will use a combination of user data and external data sources to generate personalized dashboards.

#### 4.4 **API Gateway**

The API gateway will be responsible for routing incoming requests to the appropriate services.

* **API Gateway Configuration**:
	+ Routing rules: `/login` -> `Authentication Service`, `/register` -> `Authentication Service`, `/users/{username}` -> `User Management Service`, `/dashboard` -> `Dashboard Service`

The API gateway will use a load balancer to distribute incoming traffic across multiple instances of the services.

#### 4.5 **Database**

The database will be responsible for storing user data, including credentials and profiles.

* **Database Schema**:
	+ `users` table: `id`, `username`, `password`, `email`
	+ `user_profiles` table: `id`, `user_id`, `profile_data`
	+ `user_preferences` table: `id`, `user_id`, `preferences_data`

The database will use indexing and caching to improve performance.

### 5. **TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION PLAN**
