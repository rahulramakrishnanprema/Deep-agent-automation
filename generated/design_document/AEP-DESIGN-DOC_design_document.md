**PROJECT OVERVIEW**

The AEP project aims to design and develop a comprehensive system for managing user profiles, roles, and training data. The system will provide a user-friendly dashboard for logged-in users to view their profile information, access authorized features, and navigate through the application. The project will follow an agile development methodology, with a focus on iterative development, continuous integration, and continuous deployment.

The project will consist of several key components, including a database schema, authentication APIs, role-based access control, user profile API, and a frontend dashboard. The system will be designed to ensure scalability, security, and maintainability, with a focus on providing a seamless user experience.

**REQUIREMENTS ANALYSIS**

The requirements for the AEP project have been gathered from various stakeholders, including developers, system administrators, and end-users. The requirements can be broadly categorized into several key areas:

1. **DevOps and Environment Setup**: The development team requires a working development environment, including a Git repository, CI/CD pipeline, staging database instance, and the ability to run the project locally.
2. **Basic User Dashboard UI**: Logged-in users require a simple dashboard to view their profile information, including name, email, and role.
3. **Basic User Profile API**: The system requires an API to retrieve user profile data from the database, with the ability to confirm account details.
4. **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: The system requires role-based permissions to ensure that users only access features they are authorized for.
5. **Implement Authentication APIs**: The system requires secure login and registration APIs, with the ability to issue JWT/session tokens after authentication.
6. **Setup Database Schema**: The system requires a designed and implemented database schema to store user, skills, and training data efficiently.

The acceptance criteria for each requirement have been defined, and the subtasks for each requirement have been identified. The requirements analysis has provided a clear understanding of the project's functional and non-functional requirements.

**SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE**

The AEP system will follow a microservices architecture, with several key components interacting with each other to provide the required functionality. The system architecture will consist of the following components:

1. **Database Schema**: The database schema will be designed to store user, skills, and training data efficiently. The schema will include tables for users, roles, training needs, and courses.
2. **Authentication APIs**: The authentication APIs will provide secure login and registration functionality, with the ability to issue JWT/session tokens after authentication.
3. **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: The RBAC component will ensure that users only access features they are authorized for, based on their role.
4. **User Profile API**: The user profile API will retrieve user profile data from the database, with the ability to confirm account details.
5. **Frontend Dashboard**: The frontend dashboard will provide a user-friendly interface for logged-in users to view their profile information and access authorized features.

The system architecture will be designed to ensure scalability, security, and maintainability, with a focus on providing a seamless user experience.

**DETAILED DESIGN SPECIFICATIONS**

The detailed design specifications for each component will be as follows:

1. **Database Schema**:
	* The database schema will be designed using PostgreSQL.
	* The schema will include tables for users, roles, training needs, and courses.
	* The schema will be normalized to ensure data consistency and reduce data redundancy.
2. **Authentication APIs**:
	* The authentication APIs will be designed using RESTful API principles.
	* The APIs will provide secure login and registration functionality, with the ability to issue JWT/session tokens after authentication.
	* The APIs will be designed to handle invalid login attempts and return error messages accordingly.
3. **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**:
	* The RBAC component will be designed using a middleware approach.
	* The component will ensure that users only access features they are authorized for, based on their role.
	* The component will be designed to handle attempts to access unauthorized routes and return error messages accordingly.
4. **User Profile API**:
	* The user profile API will be designed using RESTful API principles.
	* The API will retrieve user profile data from the database, with the ability to confirm account details.
	* The API will be designed to handle invalid requests and return error messages accordingly.
5. **Frontend Dashboard**:
	* The frontend dashboard will be designed using a modern frontend framework (e.g. React, Angular).
	* The dashboard will provide a user-friendly interface for logged-in users to view their profile information and access authorized features.
	* The dashboard will be designed to handle cross-browser compatibility and ensure a seamless user experience.

**TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION PLAN**

The technical implementation plan will consist of several key phases, including:

1. **Setup Git Repository and CI/CD Pipeline**: The development team will set up a Git repository and CI/CD pipeline to ensure continuous integration and continuous deployment.
2. **Implement Database Schema**: The development team will design and implement the database schema, including tables for users, roles, training needs, and courses.
3. **Implement Authentication APIs**: The development team will design and implement the authentication APIs, including secure login and registration functionality.
4. **Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: The development team will design and implement the RBAC component, including middleware to ensure role-based permissions.
5. **Implement User Profile API**: The development team will design and implement the user profile API, including retrieval of user profile data from the database.
6. **Implement Frontend Dashboard**: The development team will design and implement the frontend dashboard, including a user-friendly interface for logged-in users to view their profile information and access authorized features.

**TESTING AND QUALITY ASSURANCE**

The testing and quality assurance phase will consist of several key activities, including:

1. **Unit Testing**: The development team will write unit tests for each component to ensure that they function as expected.
2. **Integration Testing**: The development team will write integration tests to ensure that the components interact with each other correctly.
3. **Cross-Browser Testing**: The development team will perform cross-browser testing to ensure that the frontend dashboard functions correctly across different browsers.
4. **Security Testing**: The development team will perform security testing to ensure that the system is secure and protected against common web vulnerabilities.
5. **Performance Testing**: The development team will perform performance testing to ensure that the system performs well under load and stress.

**DEPLOYMENT AND OPERATIONS**

The deployment and operations phase will consist of several key activities, including:

1. **Deployment to Production**: The development team will deploy the system to production, including setup of the database schema, authentication APIs, RBAC component, user profile API, and frontend dashboard.
2. **Monitoring and Logging**: The development team will set up monitoring and logging tools to ensure that the system is running smoothly and to identify any issues that may arise.
3. **Maintenance and Updates**: The development team will perform regular maintenance and updates to ensure
