**PROJECT OVERVIEW**
======================

### Executive Summary

The AEP-DESIGN-DOC project aims to design and implement a robust authentication system for users to securely log in and access their personalized dashboard. The primary objective is to provide a seamless and secure authentication experience, ensuring the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of user data. This technical design document outlines the comprehensive plan for implementing Authentication APIs, meeting the requirements and acceptance criteria specified in Issue AEP-2.

### Business Context

The AEP system is designed to provide users with a personalized dashboard, offering a range of features and services. To ensure the security and integrity of user data, a robust authentication system is essential. The authentication system will enable users to log in securely, using a combination of username and password, and access their dashboard. The system will also provide registration APIs, allowing new users to create accounts and log in to their dashboard.

**REQUIREMENTS ANALYSIS**
=========================

### Functional Requirements

The following functional requirements have been identified:

1. **Login API**: The system shall provide a login API that accepts a username and password, authenticates the user, and returns a JWT/session token upon successful authentication.
2. **Registration API**: The system shall provide a registration API that accepts user registration data, creates a new user account, and returns a JWT/session token upon successful registration.
3. **JWT/Session Handling**: The system shall implement JWT/session handling, ensuring that authenticated users are issued a valid token, which is verified on subsequent requests.
4. **Error Handling**: The system shall return error messages for invalid login attempts, providing users with feedback on authentication failures.

### Non-Functional Requirements

The following non-functional requirements have been identified:

1. **Security**: The system shall ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of user data, using industry-standard security protocols and encryption mechanisms.
2. **Performance**: The system shall provide a responsive authentication experience, with login and registration APIs responding within a reasonable timeframe (less than 500ms).
3. **Scalability**: The system shall be designed to scale horizontally, accommodating increasing user traffic and authentication requests.
4. **Usability**: The system shall provide an intuitive and user-friendly authentication experience, with clear error messages and feedback mechanisms.

**SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE**
=======================

### High-Level System Design

The AEP authentication system will consist of the following components:

1. **Load Balancer**: Distributes incoming traffic across multiple instances of the authentication service.
2. **Authentication Service**: Handles login and registration requests, authenticates users, and issues JWT/session tokens.
3. **User Database**: Stores user registration data, including usernames, passwords, and other relevant information.
4. **Token Store**: Stores issued JWT/session tokens, enabling token verification and revocation.

### Component Overview

The following components will be used to implement the authentication system:

1. **Node.js**: As the runtime environment for the authentication service.
2. **Express.js**: As the web framework for handling login and registration requests.
3. **MongoDB**: As the user database, storing user registration data.
4. **Redis**: As the token store, storing issued JWT/session tokens.

**DETAILED DESIGN SPECIFICATIONS**
==================================

### Component Details

The following component details have been specified:

1. **Login API**:
	* HTTP Method: POST
	* Request Body: { username, password }
	* Response: { token, expiresAt }
2. **Registration API**:
	* HTTP Method: POST
	* Request Body: { username, password, email }
	* Response: { token, expiresAt }
3. **JWT/Session Handling**:
	* Token Type: JSON Web Token (JWT)
	* Token Expiration: 1 hour
	* Token Verification: Using a secret key, stored securely on the server
4. **Error Handling**:
	* Error Codes: 401 (Unauthorized), 403 (Forbidden)
	* Error Messages: Clear and concise, providing feedback on authentication failures

### Data Models

The following data models have been defined:

1. **User**:
	* username (string)
	* password (string)
	* email (string)
2. **Token**:

	* expiresAt (date)

### APIs

The following APIs have been defined:

1. **Login API**: `/auth/login`
2. **Registration API**: `/auth/register`
3. **Token Verification API**: `/auth/verify`

### Security

The following security measures have been implemented:

1. **Password Hashing**: Using bcrypt, with a salt value of 10.
2. **Token Encryption**: Using AES-256, with a secret key stored securely on the server.
3. **HTTPS**: Using TLS 1.2, with a valid certificate and private key.
