### 4.3 API Specifications and Interfaces
The `/oauth/introspect` endpoint specification:
*   **Endpoint:** `POST https://auth.company.com/oauth/introspect`
*   **Authentication:** Basic Auth using client_id and client_secret.
*   **Parameters:** `token` (required), `token_type_hint` (optional).
*   **Response:** (Application/JSON)
```json
{
    "active": true,
    "sub": "user123",
    "client_id": "webapp-client",
    "scope": "read:data write:data",
    "exp": 1639873200
}
```
*OpenAPI 3.0 spec will be published to the company's API portal.*

### 4.4 Security Architecture and Considerations
*   **Secrets:** Client secrets and database passwords will be hashed using BCrypt. Private keys for JWT signing are stored in AWS Secrets Manager and are never on disk in plaintext.
*   **Network Security:** All inter-service communication will happen within the private VPC. Public endpoints are exposed only via API Gateway.
*   **Token Security:** JWTs are signed using RS256. Access tokens have a short lifespan (1 hour). Refresh tokens are stored securely in the database and are single-use.
*   **OWASP Top 10:** Mitigations include:
    *   SQL Injection: Use Spring Data JPA parameterized queries.
    *   Broken Authentication: Use Spring Security's built-in protocols; no custom auth logic.
    *   Sensitive Data Exposure: JWTs contain minimal claims; no PII.

### 4.5 Error Handling and Logging Strategies
*   **Errors:** Will follow RFC 6749 (OAuth) and RFC 6750 (Bearer Token) error formats. Example: `{ "error": "invalid_token", "error_description": "The access token expired" }`.
*   **Logging:** Structured JSON logging will be implemented using Logback. All security-critical events (login success/failure, token issuance, admin action) will be logged as `WARN` or `INFO` level with clear audit context (e.g., `userId`, `clientId`, `ipAddress`).
*   **Monitoring:** Metrics (Micrometer) will be exposed for all endpoint latencies, error rates (4xx, 5xx), and cache hit/miss ratios.

## 5. TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION PLAN

### 5.1 Development Phases and Milestones
**Phase 1: Core Protocol Implementation (Weeks 1-4)**
*   M1.1: Spring Boot skeleton with integrated DB and Redis.
*   M1.2: Implementation of Client Credentials and Authorization Code grants.
*   M1.3: JWKS and Token Introspection endpoints.

**Phase 2: Admin API & Integration (Weeks 5-8)**
*   M2.1: CRUD Admin API for OAuth clients.
*   M2.2: Integration with User Profile Service and LDAP.
*   M2.3: Internal developer documentation and sample code.

**Phase 3: Testing, Deployment, and Rollout (Weeks 9-12)**
*   M3.1: Performance and security testing.
*   M3.2: Deployment to Staging and Pilot integration with one non-critical service.
*   M3.3: Production deployment and gradual rollout to critical services.

### 5.2 Implementation Sequence and Dependencies
1.  Set up Terraform for infrastructure (VPC, RDS, Redis) -> **Blocked on:** SRE team review.
2.  Implement `oauth_client_details` table and `client-service` module.
3.  Implement `token-services` with JWT generation and signing.
4.  Implement protocol endpoints (`oauth-controller`).
5.  Implement introspection and caching -> **Depends on:** `token-services` completion.
6.  Implement admin API -> **Depends on:** `client-service` completion.

### 5.3 Resource Allocation and Team Structure
*   **Backend Engineers (2):** Core application development.
*   **SRE (1):** Infrastructure as Code (Terraform), CI/CD pipeline setup.
*   **Security Engineer (0.5):** Part-time consultation for threat modeling and review.
*   **Tech Lead (1):** Architectural oversight, code reviews, and unblocking the team.

### 5.4 Risk Assessment and Mitigation Strategies
| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Performance of Introspection Endpoint** | Medium | High | Implement aggressive caching in Redis. Use lightweight JWT signature validation. Conduct early load testing. |
| **Complexity of Spring Security OAuth2** | High | Medium | Spike on the framework before full implementation. Create a simplified abstraction layer for common use cases. |
| **Integration with Legacy LDAP** | Medium | Medium | Implement a fallback/circuit breaker pattern. Ensure graceful degradation if LDAP is unavailable. |
| **Database Schema Migrations** | Low | High | Use Flyway for version-controlled database migrations. Test all migrations against a copy of production data. |

### 5.5 Timeline and Delivery Schedule
*   **Phase 1 Completion:** End of Week 4
*   **Phase 2 Completion:** End of Week 8
*   **Staging Ready:** End of Week 10
*   **Production Launch (GA):** End of Week 12

## 6. TESTING AND QUALITY ASSURANCE

### 6.1 Testing Strategies
*   **Unit Tests (JUnit 5, Mockito):** >80% coverage for all business logic services.
*   **Integration Tests (@SpringBootTest):** Test full HTTP stack and database integration. Use Testcontainers for a real PostgreSQL instance.
*   **System Tests:** Automated tests against a deployed staging environment, verifying all OAuth flows end-to-end.
*   **User Acceptance Testing (UAT):** Pilot service teams will test integration with their staging environments.

### 6.2 Quality Gates and Review Processes
*   **Code Review:** All PRs require at least one approval from a senior engineer. No direct pushes to main.
*   **Static Analysis:** SonarQube gates must pass (zero bugs, zero vulnerabilities, >80% coverage).
*   **Build Gate:** The CI pipeline must pass all tests before a merge is allowed.

### 6.3 Performance Testing Requirements
*   **Tool:** k6
*   **Scenario:** Ramp up to 15,000 RPS for the token introspection endpoint and hold for 10 minutes.
*   **Pass Criteria:** P99 latency < 50ms, 0 errors, CPU utilization < 70%.

### 6.4 Security Testing Considerations
*   **SAST:** Checkmarx scan on every PR.
*   **DAST:** OWASP ZAP full scan against staging environment weekly.
*   **Penetration Test:** Mandatory third-party pen test before production release.

### 6.5 Monitoring and Observability Plan
*   **Metrics (Prometheus):** `http_server_requests_seconds`, `jvm_memory_used`, `redis_command_latency_seconds`, `cache_hits_total`.
*   **Logs (ELK Stack):** Structured logs ingested into Elasticsearch for auditing and debugging.
*   **Dashboards (Grafana):** Real-time dashboards for API health, latency, and error rates.
*   **Alerts (PagerDuty):**
    *   **Warning:** Error rate > 1% for 5 minutes.
    *   **Critical:** Error rate > 5% for 2 minutes OR endpoint latency p99 > 200ms.

## 7. DEPLOYMENT AND OPERATIONS

### 7.1 Deployment Strategy and Environments
*   **Environments:** `dev` -> `staging` -> `production`.
*   **Strategy:** Blue-Green deployment using AWS ECS and API Gateway stages. Traffic is shifted from the old (blue) task set to the new (green) set. Rollback is achieved by shifting traffic back to blue.

### 7.2 Infrastructure Requirements
*   **AWS Aurora PostgreSQL:** db.t4g.medium (dev), db.r6g.large (prod) - 2 instances in multi-AZ.
*   **ElastiCache Redis:** cache.t4g.micro (dev), cache.r6g.xlarge (prod) with cluster mode enabled.
*   **ECS Fargate:** 2 vCPU / 4GB RAM (dev), 4 vCPU / 16GB RAM (prod) per task. Auto-scaling from 2 to 10 tasks.

### 7.3 CI/CD Pipeline Design
1.  **On PR:** Code build, unit tests, SAST scan.
2.  **On Merge to Main:** Build container image, push to ECR, run integration tests, deploy to `dev`.
3.  **Manual Promotion:** Deploy to `staging` upon manual approval. Run performance and DAST tests.
4.  **Production Release:** Manual approval triggers blue-green deployment to `production`.

### 7.4 Monitoring, Alerting, and Maintenance
*   **Monitoring:** As described in Section 6.5.
*   **Alerting:** SRE on-call rotation for critical alerts.
*   **Maintenance:** Weekly rotation of signing keys (automated). Monthly review of client credentials and pruning of inactive clients.

### 7.5 Disaster Recovery and Business Continuity
*   **RTO:** < 15 minutes.
*   **RPO:** < 5 minutes.
*   **Strategy:**
    *   Database: Aurora cross-region read replica can be promoted to primary.
    *   Redis: ElastiCache with multi-AZ replication.
    *   Application: Terraform scripts can provision the entire stack in a secondary region. DNS failover (Route53) can redirect traffic.

*This diagram shows the flow of a token introspection request through API Gateway, the Auth Service, Redis cache, and the PostgreSQL database.*

### Appendix A.2: Sample Code Snippet (Token Introspection)
```java
@PostMapping("/oauth/introspect")
public ResponseEntity<Map<String, Object>> introspectToken(@RequestParam("token") String token) {
    // 1. Check cache first
    IntrospectionResponse cachedResponse = cacheManager.getIntrospectionResult(token);
    if (cachedResponse != null) {
        return ResponseEntity.ok(cachedResponse.toMap());
    }

    // 2. Validate JWT signature & parse claims
    Jws<Claims> jwsClaims = jwtParser.parseClaimsJws(token);
    Claims claims = jwsClaims.getBody();

    // 3. Check DB for early revocation
    boolean isRevoked = tokenRepository.isRevoked(claims.getId());

    // 4. Build response
    IntrospectionResponse response = new IntrospectionResponse();
    response.setActive(!isRevoked && claims.getExpiration().after(new Date()));
    response.setSub(claims.getSubject());
    response.setScope(claims.get("scope", String.class));

    // 5. Cache result
    cacheManager.cacheIntrospectionResult(token, response, getTimeToLive(claims.getExpiration()));

    return ResponseEntity.ok(response.toMap());
}
